** PHP .dotfile manager.
   Actually only written for my own amusement and because I can really use it. I
   know that there are enough dotfile managers already, but I really only need a
   lightweight application. The configuration is done via a file named
   config.ini in the root folder of the aadm directory. First the config.ini
   must be adapted, here the exact paths to the dotfiles repository and the name
   of the JSON file are given. Also the command to install packages:

   For example

*** config.ini
    #+BEGIN_SRC ini
[locations]
dotfilesDir=~/.dotfiles
json=files.json

[executables]
installation=sudo pacman -S --needed
    #+END_SRC

*** files.json
    #+BEGIN_SRC json
{
  "ApplicationName": {
    "requirements": [
      "app1",
      "app2",
      "app3",
    ],
    "files": [
      "/path/to/file/file.rc"
    ],
    "dirs": [
      "/path/to/complete/dir"
    ]
  }
}
    #+END_SRC
